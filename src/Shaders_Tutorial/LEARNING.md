# Lesson: Shaders

## Overview

In this lesson, I learned about **GLSL** and the basics of writing shaders _(both vertex and fragment)_. The concept of **uniforms** was introduced, and I also learned how to abstract things related to shaders into their own class.

## Key Concepts

- **GLSL** — The `C`-like language used to write shaders in OpenGL.
- **GLSL Types** — GLSL supports _vectors_ and _matrices_, along with other basic primitives.
- **Shader I/Os** — Shaders in the graphics pipeline can only communicate via their _inputs_ and _outputs_, which is how information gets passed from shader to shader.
- **Uniforms** - Another way to pass data _(from the CPU)_ to a shader.

## Boring Notes _(My Personal Yap Section :))_

I'll get around to this...
